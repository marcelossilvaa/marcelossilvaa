Hello, my name is Marcelo, I am from Brazil, and I am 23 years old. I am a person fascinated by technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

I began my academic journey at the Federal University of Sergipe, where I pursued a degree in Petroleum Engineering for 3 years. However, my true passion has always been technology, where I felt a strong connection. I transitioned to Computer Science in 2021 and am currently in the 6th semester at UniAmÃ©rica.

I specialize in Front-End development. Here are the technologies I am proficient in:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- React
- NextJs
- TailwindCSS
- Git/GitHub

Notable courses I have completed include:
- CS50 Harvard, Computer Science.
- Front-End Development (One project, by Alura + Oracle).
- React Bootcamp (by XPe).

In a professional context, I have been involved in various activities:
- Volunteer at AIESEC.
- Extension projects at UFS, at the Center for Entrepreneurship.
- Volunteer at the Estudar Foundation.
- Programming teacher at CEJP (private school) for middle school.
- Co-Founder of inkPen, a startup in educational innovations.
